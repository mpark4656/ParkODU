Heroku leaves applications inactive when there is no activity. You may have to wait
a few minutes before seeing the page after you click this link.

Originally, the application was connected to MongoDB server running on local
development machine. Once hosted on Heroku, a MongoDB app from mLab was utilized.
The app is no longer supported in Heroku. Currently, the demo application is connected
to Atlas Cloud MongoDB.
